# Pretty-Flat-Boston-Case
A variant of the Boston Keyboard that has a very slight 0.5 degree angle.

The Boston keyboard is 120% compact battleship design created by Pylon.
I really like the design, but my wrists don't like angled keyboards much. And so I created a variant of the Left and Right Halves of the case's model to become "pretty flat".

The keyboard now has a slight 0.5 degree angle, which was the smallest angle I could get for clearance of parts without raising the height of the board itself.

This model was designed to be compatible with all the other current parts of the 0.7J hotswap 3DP design (including the map!)
**However, this has NOT been tested yet.**
