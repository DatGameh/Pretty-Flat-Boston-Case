# Pretty-Flat-Boston-Case
A variant of the Boston Keyboard that has a very slight 0.5 degree angle.

The Boston keyboard is 120% compact battleship design created by Pylon.
I really like the design, but my wrists don't like the angle of some keyboards. And so I created a variant of the Left and Right Halves of the case's model to be "pretty flat".

The case now has a slight 0.5 degree angle, which was the smallest angle I could get for clearance of parts without raising the height of the board itself.

**This model was designed to be compatible with all the other current parts of the 0.7J hotswap 3DP design** (including the map!)
**NOTE: This has NOT been tested yet.**
